        I have played the French horn since 4th grade. I have participated in ensembles inside and outside of school. I also take private lessons outside of school.

        For 9 years, I have gone outside with my parents to hike on weekends when the weather is comfortable. It is fun to see nature and get fresh air.

        On Sundays in the spring and fall, I would go out to bike with my dad. We would bike on the trails nearby in the afternoon.
